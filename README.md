Hi Team,

I ordered OnePlus6 from my Amazon prime account for Rs32,647 as No Cost EMI for 3 Months using HDFC Credit card.
Order details:
Order date: 12-Aug-2018
Order #: 171-5677555-8352303
Order total: 32647.10

As per  No-Cost EMI, it will be 32647/3 = 10882.2 (Per Month). But from HDFC bank I'm getting the EMI payments as below,
10765.33+353.67(EMI1), 10881.95+237.05(EMI2), (10999.82+119.16(EMI3). I paid the 2 EMIs and asked the HDFC bank and they replied, "We HDFC usually don't take extra for No Cost EMI.
Their should be a problem with Amazon side". And I talked to Amazon customer service from my first month EMI regarding this and they are saying, it is an issue from HDFC bank side.
I'm continuously moving to-and-fro between Bank and Amazon. I don't know what's the mistake I did other than I bought from Amazon?

Do you guys thinking I'm completely free to talk with you regarding this issue for last 3 Months?
Please provide me the proper and valid reason why I'm being charged extra?

Hereby attached the payment I made for last 2 EMI. Please fix the issue as soon as possible and this issue makes me really worried.

Thanks,
Sridhar
